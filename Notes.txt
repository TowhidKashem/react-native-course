React Native:

<View> = div
<Text> = all text must be wrapped in it

Flexbox in RN by default positions items under each other not next to like the web, every item is implemented in flex box by default so no display flex needed

defaults:

display flex;
flexDirection: column;

You should use StyleSheet.create({}) instead of a plain {} in case the RN team offers performance optimizations for the wrapper in the future, but as of right now there is no difference, it also throws validation errors

Show the splash screen a little bit longer until some async function resolves (e.g. loading fonts):

	 import { AppLoading } from "expo";

  const [dataLoaded, setDataLoaded] = useState(false);

  if (!dataLoaded)
    return (
      <AppLoading
        startAsync={fetchFonts}
        onFinish={() => {
          setDataLoaded(true);
        }}
        onError={(error) => console.log(error)}
      />
    );

2 ways to manage style re-use:

Wrap it in a component:

const HeaderText = ({.children }) => <Text styles={styles.myHeader}>{children}</Text> 

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  myHeader: {
    fontFamily: ‘open-sans’,
    width: "100%",
    height: 200,
    flex: 1,
  },
  foo: {
		// bar…
	 }
});

Or export global styles:

	import defaultStyles from ‘styles/headerStyles’

	<Text styles={defaultStyles.myHeader}>Hey</Text>

export default StyleSheet.create({
  myHeader: {
    fontFamily: ‘open-sans’,
    width: "100%",
    height: 200,
    flex: 1,
  },
  foo: {
		// bar…
	 }
});


<Text> is the ONLY component that passes it’s styles down to nested text components!

When using the Dimensions component, the difference between window and screen is that on Android the screen subtracts from the status bar height, on IOS it doesn’t matter
   - usually you always want to use window

You can set up a listener on dimension change and update a state value on each change, that way when using dimension based values they update when the user changes the phone orientation:

	Dimensions.addEventListener(‘change’, () => { //etc.. });

—

The ScreenOrientation import from ‘expo’ lets you do more like locking a screen in a particular orientation for example

	ScreenOrientation.lockAsync(ScreenOrientation.OrientationLock.PORTRAIT);

—-

In app.json setting the value for the “orientation” key changes whether the app can be rotated or not, default allows both portrait and landscape

—-

Wrap your code in this to make sure the keyboard never overlays an input field:

	<KeyboardAvoidingView />

On IOS behavior=“position” works best and on android behavior=“padding”

Similarly there is a <SafeAreaView />, wrapping your content in this ensures notches on a phone and such don’t overlay the content. This component should be placed at the utmost base of the app.

——

> Platform.OS lets you access what OS the app is running on

> Platform.Version gives access to version

You can merge in different objects based on the OS like so:

     {
     …styles.headerBase,
…Platform.select({
    ios:  styles.headerIOS,
    android: styles.headerAndroid
});
}

——

If you name a file

<filename>.ios.js
<filename>.android.js	

When importing don’t use the .platform part, just import as usual:

	import Button from ‘Button’;

React native will load the relevant file per OS

If a file has too many if checks for platform it’s better just to load different files for different OS’s

——

Navigate to a new screen using react navigation package:

	props.navigation.navigate(‘MyComponent’);

To load the same screen over itself (e.g. dropbox folder screen but with different data) use push:

	props.navigation.push(‘MyComponent’);

But usually this isn’t needed in most apps

Programmatically go back:

	props.navigation.goBack();

Go back to the utmost first screen:

	props.navigation.popToTop();

Get a parameter:

	navigationData.navigation.getParam(‘mealId’);

——

For performance increase use enableScreens from ‘react-native-screens’;

——

Background images:

<ImageBackground src={…}>
	 <Text>Foreground Text</Text>
</ImageBackground>

——

This package makes building cross platform headers easier:

	yarn add react-navigation-header-buttons

——

The 3 types of phone navigation:

* Drawer
* Stack
* Tab

Debugging Redux in React Native Apps

You can debug Redux in React Native apps with help of the React Native Debugger tool: https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/blob/master/docs/redux-devtools-integration.md

1) Make sure you got the React Native Debugger installed (https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger)
2) Enable JS Debugging in the running app (open development overlay via CTRL + M / CMD + M on Android devices, CMD + D on iOS devices)
3) Install the redux-devtools-extension package via npm install --save-dev redux-devtools-extension (https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-devtools-extension)
4) Enable Redux debugging in your code:
* import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
* import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';
* const store = createStore(reducer, composeWithDevTools());

Important: Make sure you remove this code when building your app for production!

------------------------------

* useReducer hook over useState if there are many values to manage (e.g. form state)

* <Flatlist /> has props for easily implementing "Pull to refresh" functionality

* use createSwitchNavigator() for auth screens, it supresses back button action (v4 not v5!)

* you can dispatch a redux action outside of the provider tags by using refs:

    navRef.current.dispatch(foo());

    <ShopNavigator ref={navRef} />

* if you need to log a user out automatically after a session token expires (via setTimeout) you can listen 
  to the state change e.g. when the redux session value changes to null (after being cleared) fire the navigate 
  function and take the user to the login screen put this logic at a base template level so that it happens no 
  matter which route the user is in

* SQLlite queries need to be run inside transaction functions, this ensures that if any part of the query fails they all fail (to prevent corupted data)

* in a SQLlite function, the arguments are:

    1. the query
    2. an array of dynamic values that can be plugged into the query (in the query use `?` and they will be filled in the same order as values 
       that appear in the array. This also has the added benefit of sanitizing input to prevent sql injections)
    3. success callback
    4. error callback

* wrap a SQLlite function into a promise and in the success callback resolve it and in the error callback reject it, that way you can attach then() and catch()
handlerss in the place where you invoke it and it's cleaner to handle it this way
